## Welcome to my GitHub page, where I have a page on the internet.

I'll update this page with what I'm working on these days, or I'll forget about it.

## Current list of projects I don't have time to work on / Random ideas

- Learn Jekyll/GitHub Pages to make cool pages for free for projects
- Remake [Pause Ahead by Askiisoft](http://askiisoft.com/games/pause-ahead/) so that its not stranded in Flash

[Make a page like this / I want to keep this link to pimp this page later](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)
